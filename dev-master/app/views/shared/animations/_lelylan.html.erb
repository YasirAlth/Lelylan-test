              <a class="btn-lelylan" href="#">Lelylan receives the request &raquo;</a>
            </div>

            <p>
            A user turn on a light using the Lelylan dashboard or a third party application
            (e.g voice, gesture). This request is sent to Lelylan where all logics
            take place.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="second-step">
            <div class="action">
              <a class="btn-lelylan" href="#">The request is forwarded to the physical device &raquo;</a>
            </div>

            <p>
            Lelylan receives the request and forwards it to the connected physical device.
            Lelylan does not wait for the physical device to apply the request and returns
            to the user the expected device representation with a successful response
            (optimistic async flow).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="third-step">
            <div class="action">
              <a class="btn-lelylan" href="#">Reatime notifications when changes are applied &raquo;</a>
            </div>

            <p>
            Once the physical device applies the request a message is sent to Lelylan,
            which in turn, notifies the user that the light is now on.
